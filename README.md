- There is a basic part that only requires a web browser, preferably a recent version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

- For the more advanced part:

*Note - this section might be challenging, if you are not familiar with the technologies used. Therefore, we made it optional. You are welcome to experiment.*

    - Prepare your development cloud sandbox IBM Blockchain Platform by following the three steps described at: https://ibm-blockchain.github.io/
