### Hands-on lab preparation

- If you do not already have one, sign up for an IBMid and create your IBM Cloud account from this [link](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/).

- There is a basic part that only requires a web browser, preferably a recent version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

- For the more advanced part:

    *Note - this section might be challenging, if you are not familiar with the technologies used. Therefore, we made it optional. You are welcome to experiment.*
    
    Ubuntu is usually a development-friendly environment. We encourage you to have it running on your laptop on a virtual machine. One way to do that is to create the virtual machine from an [Ubuntu ISO image](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) using hypervisors like [VMWare](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), or [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page).
    
    Following are the preparation steps:
    - Install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), if you do not have it already installed.

    - Prepare your development cloud sandbox IBM Blockchain Platform by following the three steps described at: https://ibm-blockchain.github.io/
